# YelpDatabase 

YelpDatabase is a project completed by myself and a Sam Brache (Github: smbrache) for CPEN 221: Principles of Software Construction. By permission of Professor Sathish Gopalakrishnan, students are allowed to share this project as a part of their personal portfolios.

YelpDatabase is both a database model that stores restaurant, review, and user data along with a client-server application that allows users to simultaneously request for entries, and edit the database entries. 

Furthermore, YelpDatabase was built with extra features inclusive of k-means-clustering and least squares regression statistical learning algorithm. The application utilizes JSON to store the data and ANTLR (developed by Terrence Parr) to handle query requests.

Lastly, I should point out that a large focus in this project was regression testing and test driven development. At all stages of development, it was our goal to maintain 100% code coverage using meaningful and descriptive tests that covered a wide variety of inputs. It was critical that tests monitored and verified the functionality of all object functions during development.

It is my hope to continue to expand on this project by developing a more robust ANTLR query system, and more statistical learning algorithms.
